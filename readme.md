## Defaults
Blips that are adopted at RIO by default and are not mentioned in every radar. New defaults are marked with (*).

#### Techniques
* Microservices

#### Platforms
* Amazon Web Services - AWS
*<br/>AWS is our default provider for IaaS and PaaS. We prefer AWS platform services over other managed services, over self-hosted OSS and over self-built solutions.*
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
*<br/>MongoDB Atlas is a highly available, fully managed database. Our default option for all services requiring a document database.*
* Amazon ECS
*<br/>Most of our workloads are running as containers on ECS. We like that the fully managed container scheduler frees us of the operational burden.*   
* Kafka
*<br/>Kafka is our central infrastructure, that powers our streaming, messaging, queueing and replication.*
* Amazon CloudWatch
*<br/>Although we recognise the limitation of CloudWatch, we also acknowledge that it is highly integrated with all other AWS services and provides a baseline monitoring and reaction capability valuable to us.*
* Amazon Athena (*)
*<br/>[AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/de/athena/) is a managed Presto service. In combination with the AWS Glue Data Catalog it enables you to query S3 data with SQL. It supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro and Parquet. It is especially useful to do first data explorations.*
* Amazon Code Tools (*)
*<br/>New deployments started to use AWS CodeBuild, CodePipeline and CodeDeploy as CI/CD tool chain. This allows, that the pipelines are created via code, that is part of the service repsository.*
* Amazon Fargate (*)
*<br/>AWS Fargate is a recent entry into the docker-as-a-service space, currently limited to the US-East-1 region. For teams using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate is a good alternative without having to manage, provision and configure any underlying EC2 instances or clusters. Fargate allows defining (ECS or EKS – ECS for Kubernetes) tasks as a Fargate type, and they will run on the AWS Fargate infrastructure. If you like the focus on business functionality that AWS Lambda gives you, Fargate is the closest you can get when applications can't be deployed as single functions.*
* Amazon Glue ETL (*)
*<br/>[AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/de/glue/) is a managed ETL service. It can be used to batch process data in reoccurring jobs. Under the hood Glue runs your code in Apache Spark.*
* Amazon Quicksight (*)
*<br/>[AWS Quicksight](https://aws.amazon.com/de/quicksight/) is a cloud based BI service. In an AWS environment it is lightweight and it is able to connect to S3, S3 via Athena, Redshift and many other data sources. Quicksight enables users to query data either with SQL or with a graphical tool. Results can be visualized on Dashboards.*

#### Tools
* AWS CloudFormation
*<br/>CloudFormation is our default tool to model and provide AWS infrastructure.*
* ESLint and TSLint
* Gradle
* Maven
* DataDog
* AWS SNS/SQS
*<br/><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">AWS SQS</a> allows easy integration with Lambdas and therefore allowing multiple consumers of the same asyncronous event, independent from the number of partitions like Kafka, with guaranteed at least once consumption in case of successful processing and controlled mechanism for retries other via the visibility timeout or retry policy with the option of an out of the box dead-letter queue. If in-order processing is required it allows it through the FIFO variant (this does not integrate with lambdas).*
* OpenAPI (*)
*<br/>The <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Specification</a> (formerly known as Swagger) is a community-driven open specification within the OpenAPI Initiative, a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project.
<br/>The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.*

#### Languages & Frameworks
* Kotlin
* Spring Boot
* TypeScript
* React
* Redux

#### Techniques
* Continuous Delivery (*)
*<br/>If you are wondering “What comes after agile?,” you should look towards continuous delivery. While your development processes may be fully optimized, it still might take your organization weeks or months to get a single change into production. Continuous delivery focuses on maximizing automation including infrastructure as code, environment management and deployment automation to ensure your system is always ready for production. It is about tightening your feedback loops and not putting off anything until the end. Continuous delivery is not the same as continuous deployment, which means deploying every change to production. Continuous delivery is not a cowboy show. It puts you in charge of your production environment. The business can pick and choose what and when to deploy. If you think you’ve nailed agile development, but aren’t considering how to achieve continuous delivery, you really haven’t even started.*
* Multi AWS accounts (*)
*<br/>To decouple our bounded contexts and to limit the blast radius, we are moving from a single production account to multiple accounts.  One AWS account per bounded context.*
* Serverless (*)
*<br/>We want to avoid operating infrastructure ourself as much as possible, because we want to focus on writing code relevant for our business. Servless services from AWS are other service providers help with that.
<br/>Our decision to use Kafka instead of Kinesis is limiting are capability to embrace some serverless use cases.
<br/>See AWS Lambda description for more details*

## Defaults on Hold
Blips that should not be adopted at RIO by default and are already removed from the radar. New defaults are marked with (*).

#### Languages & Frameworks
* Node.js for services (*)
* Spring Boot 1 (*)

## Archived

### Last in adopt

#### Platforms

* Amazon Cognito
*<br/>Cognito is used as part of our IAM solution. No other team is affected by Cognito and any change would be limited to this context.*
* Amazon API Gateway (*)
*<br/>It should only be used by Lambdas if needed, but not for Services, where a Load balancer is more appropriate*
* Kafka Streams (*)
*<br/>We did not see enough value for the effort.*

#### Techniques 

* TDD, BDD
*<br/>No agreement on a strong adopt recommendation. Will be addressed as part of a code quality initiative.*
* Immutable data structures (*)
*<br/>It is in use but as a programming style, does not need to be enforced via the Technology Radar*

*<br/>It is a solution provided by AWS and Fargate container, therefore, does not need to be enforced via the Technology Radar*
