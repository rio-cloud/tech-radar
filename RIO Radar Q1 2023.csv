Amazon Athena,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"[AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/de/athena/) is a managed Presto service. In combination with the AWS Glue Data Catalog it enables you to query S3 data with SQL. It supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro and Parquet. It is especially useful to do first data explorations."
Amazon CloudWatch,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"Although we recognise the limitation of CloudWatch, we also acknowledge that it is highly integrated with all other AWS services and provides a baseline monitoring and reaction capability valuable to us."
Amazon Code Tools,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"New deployments started to use AWS CodeBuild, CodePipeline and CodeDeploy as CI/CD tool chain. This allows, that the pipelines are created via code, that is part of the service repsository."
Amazon Corretto,fundamental,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,
Amazon ECS,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,Most of our workloads are running as containers on ECS. We like that the fully managed container scheduler frees us of the operational burden.
Amazon Fargate,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"AWS Fargate is a recent entry into the docker-as-a-service space, currently limited to the US-East-1 region. For teams using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate is a good alternative without having to manage, provision and configure any underlying EC2 instances or clusters. Fargate allows defining (ECS or EKS – ECS for Kubernetes) tasks as a Fargate type, and they will run on the AWS Fargate infrastructure. If you like the focus on business functionality that AWS Lambda gives you, Fargate is the closest you can get when applications can't be deployed as single functions."
Amazon Glue ETL,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,[AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/de/glue/) is a managed ETL service. It can be used to batch process data in reoccurring jobs. Under the hood Glue runs your code in Apache Spark.
Amazon Quicksight,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"[AWS Quicksight](https://aws.amazon.com/de/quicksight/) is a cloud based BI service. In an AWS environment it is lightweight and it is able to connect to S3, S3 via Athena, Redshift and many other data sources. Quicksight enables users to query data either with SQL or with a graphical tool. Results can be visualized on Dashboards."
Amazon Web Services - AWS,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"AWS is our default provider for IaaS and PaaS. We prefer AWS platform services over other managed services, over self-hosted OSS and over self-built solutions."
API first,fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,"The idea of <a href=""https://www.programmableweb.com/api-university/understanding-api-first-design"">API first</a> is to develop the API together with the stakeholders before starting with the implementation. The benefit is to get feedback early and think more about the requirements for the API instead of the implementation details. For us the service interface includes published events which should go through the same design process."
AWS CDK,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"The <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/index.html"">AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)</a> is a software development framework for defining infrastructure as code imperatively in multiple languages. It uses CloudFormation to provision the infrastructure.Compared to the declarative approach, CDK has a bit more complex setup, but offers many high level Constructs which abstracts away lot of details which leads to less lines of code. In addition, teams can build and share their own Constructs and benefit from others learnings."
AWS DynamoDB,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"DynamoDB is used for all services where its capabilities are sufficient, we recommend to use it. It is a fully managed, highly scalable, low latency NoSQL database."
Continuous Delivery,fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,"If you are wondering “What comes after agile?,” you should look towards continuous delivery. While your development processes may be fully optimized, it still might take your organization weeks or months to get a single change into production. Continuous delivery focuses on maximizing automation including infrastructure as code, environment management and deployment automation to ensure your system is always ready for production. It is about tightening your feedback loops and not putting off anything until the end. Continuous delivery is not the same as continuous deployment, which means deploying every change to production. Continuous delivery is not a cowboy show. It puts you in charge of your production environment. The business can pick and choose what and when to deploy. If you think you’ve nailed agile development, but aren’t considering how to achieve continuous delivery, you really haven’t even started."
DataDog,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,

Featuer Toggles,fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,For [Feature Toggles](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) we use [split.io](https://www.split.io/) to manage feature toggles of released applications. For short living toggles or for prototypes one could also cosider to use url based feature toggles instead.
Gradle,fundamental,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,
Kafka,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"Kafka is our central infrastructure, that powers our streaming, messaging, queueing and replication."
Kotlin for backend,fundamental,Languanges,FALSE,"<a href=""http://kotlinlang.org/"">Kotlin</a> has experienced an accelerated rate of adoption and rapid growth of tooling support. Some of the reasons behind its popularity are its concise syntax, null safety, ease of transition from Java and interoperability with other JVM-based languages in general, and that it doubles as a great introductory language to functional programming. With JetBrains adding the ability to compile Kotlin to native binarieson multiple platforms, as well as transpile to JavaScript, we believe it has the potential of much wider use by the larger community of mobile and native application developers. Although at the time of writing, some of the tooling such as static and coverage code analysis have yet to mature, given our experience of using Kotlin in many production applications, we believe Kotlin is ready for general adoption."
Microservices,fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,
MongoDB Atlas,fundamental,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is a highly available, fully managed database. Our default option for all services requiring a document database."
Multi AWS accounts,fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,"To decouple our bounded contexts and to limit the blast radius, we are moving from a single production account to multiple accounts.  One AWS account per bounded context."
npm,fundamental,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,
OpenAPI,fundamental,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"The <a href=""https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification"">OpenAPI Specification</a> (formerly known as Swagger) is a community-driven open specification within the OpenAPI Initiative, a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project.<br/>The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service."
React,fundamental,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,
Redux,fundamental,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,
Serverless,fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,"We want to avoid operating infrastructure ourself as much as possible, because we want to focus on writing code relevant for our business. Servless services from AWS are other service providers help with that.<br/>Our decision to use Kafka instead of Kinesis is limiting are capability to embrace some serverless use cases.<br/>See AWS Lambda description for more details"
Spring Boot 2,fundamental,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,
SSO federated to AD,fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,We want to avoid the work and securty risk of manual user management in services used by employees and instead federate all logins to our AD.
Trunk-based development,fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,"From <a href=""https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/"">trunkbaseddevelopment.com</a>:<br /> <i>A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ or master, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.</i> <br /> Short-lived branches, that are merged within the day are allowed."
TypeScript,fundamental,Languanges,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/"">Typescript</a> is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. We believe that the types (and the correspoding IDE support like autocompletion) helps us developers improving the code quality. Thus, Typescript is the recommended language when setting up a new frontend project."
"You build it, you run it - light",fundamental,Techniques,FALSE,"YBIYRI is the true meaning of DevOps. The team not only writes the software, but owns the whole product lifecycle. Including the responsibility to deploy and operate the service. If a service owned by a team is hard to operate and creates many alerts, the team cannot offload that pain to somebody else. The intended behaviour is that the makes the service more resilient, reduces the number of alerts and makes them more actionable.<br /><br /> As we currently cannot have on-call duties during non-office hours, we still want to close the feedback loop from production as much as possible. This is why we start with YBIYRI light, where the team takes on those responsibilities during office hours. As a result all capabilities and skills for proper YBIYRI needs to be in place."
Account Modules,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"Account Modules are serverless applications, which are used to provide integrations e.g. for Bitbucket and Code Pipeline or common fuctionalities such as the permission listener module, which perists permissions from Kafka topic to DynamoDB. They are not consisdered as shared libraries, as the are encapsulated applications, which do not provide business logic. Account Modules are broadly used at RIO."
Amazon DynamoDB Streams,adopt,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"A DynamoDB Stream is an order flow of information about changes to items in a DynamoDB Table. A Stream can be used as an input source for a Lambda function and enables Serverless, event driven development in near real time.DynamoDB Streams could be used for different purposes. An example could be to generate domain events from database changes as the outbox pattern works best with transactional databases. Another use case might be to generate read models of the data."
Amazon RDS Aurora,adopt,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"Amazon RDS Aurora is our preferred option for relational databases. Aurora offers MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible databases with a new architecture optimized for distributed cloud environment.<br /> Aurora Serverless flavor, however, is not meant for production workloads and thus should not be used. Therefore use the provisioned version"
Application Performance Monitoring (APM),adopt,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"Observability is a must-have in order to understand and operator distributed Cloud Systems. Correlating traces, logs and metrics enables you to understand your dependencies and reducing latency and eliminate errors."
Architecture decision records,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"Important design and architecture decisions should be documented. This helps our future self to understand why and in what context those decisions where made and what where the consequences.<br /><br />Those lightweight architecture decision records should be kept in the same repository as the service affected by the decision. If the decision is on a bounded context level, it should be kept in a separate repository within the project of the context. Macro architecture decisions are kept in Confluence."
ArchUnit,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.archunit.org/"">ArchUnit</a> is test framework for Java (and Kotlin) applications that allows to test the architecture of an application. It is our preferred way to continuously test our architectures, e.g. hexagonal architectures."
AWS Config,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,AWS Config continuously monitor configuration changes of AWS resources and check them against compliance rules we define. It allows viewing organization-wide compliance reports and identifying non-compliant accounts and resources. We decided to use AWS managed solution instead of OSS solutions like CloudCustodian to avoid additional hosting and maintaining efforts.
AWS DocumentDB,adopt,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/de/documentdb/"">DocumentDB</a> is a managed database from AWS, providing a MongoDB compatible API. It has been announced early 2019. Compared to e.g. Mongo Altas is lives within your VPC which causes lower latencies. In addition AWS resource policies as well as IAM policies could be used for permission management. According to our Backup strategy we recommend to use DpocumentDB only for services with lower cirtitcality, as there is no popper way for cross AWS account backups of your data. So everything is lost in case you loose you account."
AWS Lambda,adopt,(Managed) Services,FALSE,"AWS Lambda should be used for infrastructure, delivery, streaming and continuous governance use cases. Everywhere where a tight integration with AWS APIs and almost no business logic is required.<br /> We also tried Lambda functions as a replacement for containerized services with behavior. But we learned that the concepts and tooling are not there yet. The advantages of a serverless infrastructure are outweight by the disadvantage of not having a cohesive structure for the business logic.<br />"
AxonIQ,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://axoniq.io/"">AxonIQ</a> is a framework that helps to build Event Sourcing applications using CQRS architecture pattern. It integrates well with Spring, supports relational databases or MongoDB as event store and has integration for Kafka. It helps to start solving problems with Event Sourcing instead of solving Event Sourcing problems providing solution to read model reacreation, different event handling strategies within or out of the transactional boundaries of the aggregate and much more."
BrowserStack,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"Browserstack has been introduced in 2017 to support IE browser tests and we only have one account right now, nobody feels responsible right now so this has been escalated to higher places to decide how to continue, which would include providing the teams with sufficient accounts to support their testing efforts."
Corretto,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,Amazon Corretto is our favorite OpenJDK solution since we get a no-cost long-term supported distribute that receives security as well as performance enhancements. We discourage the usage of OracleJDK.
CQRS,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html"">CQRS - Command Query Responsibility Segregation</a> is an architectural pattern that implies using different models for updates and reads. A command is any method that mutates state and a query is any method that returns a value, but does not change state.<br /> CQRS allows, but does not require different persisted data models. This is in contrast to CRUD applications, where you use a single model.<br /> CQRS in conjunction with Event Sourcing and is a very powerful and complex pattern. See also Event Sourcing."
Dependency License check,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"All Software projects should implement a Dependencies License check and periodically to identify if any of the project's dependencies have a license that should not used, avoiding legal issues."
Dependency Vulnerability check,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"All Software projects should implement a Dependencies Vulnerability check and periodically perform an analysis in the attempt to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project’s dependencies, avoiding the usage of problematic dependencies."
Domain-Driven Design,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""http://dddcommunity.org/"">Domain-Driven-Design</a> was first described by Eric Evans in 2004. It is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core buiseness concepts. The cpmplexity of the domain is supposed to be the most significant in most projects. Hence, the focus during the design process should be placed on the core domain and the domain logic. Additionally, DDD should initiate a creative and iterative collaboration between technical and domain experts to be able to understand the conceptual heart of complex problems."
Event Sourcing,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing"">Event Sourcing</a> as an architectural pattern defines an approach to handling operations on data that's driven by a sequence of events which are recorded in an append-only store.<br /> Event Sourcing is typically used in conjunction CQRS and matches our event-driven architecture. It also brings technical and conceptual complexity, therefor usage of those patterns depends on the complexity of the problem to solve and the experience of the team.<br /> It allows you to reduce accidental complexity when working in a complex domain. Due to the event based history, it is possible to react to future changes in business requirements in a flexible way.<br /> When working with EventStorming or EventModelling the transition from design to implementation is possible with any transition.<br /> The above link contains a thourough <i>When to use this pattern</i> analysis."
Google Analytics,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"Google Analytics itself is well known. At RIO we think, that it should be part of every SPA to gain insight about the user behaviour to improve the usability."
Hexagonal architecture,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"Hexagonal Architecture is a software design pattern, which fits well into Domain-Driven-Design approaches. It is also known as onion architecture, clean architecture or ports and adapters. The pattern describes a 2-dimensional layered architecture with the domain in its core, surrounded by application and framework layers. Objects (adapters) from outer layers can implement interfaces (ports) of inner layers but are not used directly. This architecture pattern helps separating the concerns of your application and focussing on the core domain for better maintainability and less technical debt."
io-ts,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"Typescript prevents error by performing compile-time checks. Nevertheless, a lot of errors can happen during runtime, especially in SPAs when dealing with RESTFul responses. IO-Ts closes this gab by offering runtime validation for Typescript. (bearbeitet)"
Jib,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib"">Jib</a> is able to build Docker Images for Java applications. Jib is daemonless and it separates your application into several image layers. That makes incremental builds possible. With proper caching in place, you are able to reduce your build time and to simplify your CI-system significantly. It is available as Maven and Gradle plugin."
LocalDynamoDB,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"The LocalDynamoDB is a in-memory, sqlite based mock for the Amazon DynamoDB service. It is provided & maintained by Amazon. It allows to test DynamoDB-related code locally against the DynamoDB API, without the need for Docker or an AWS account. We consider it the standard tool at RIO for testing DynamoDB-related code. It is preferred over docker based solutions as the in memory solution is more light weight and takes less time to spin up."
Microfrontends,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"We evaluate a couple of different approaches for implementing micro frontends. Our goal is to enable teams to independendly deploy and maintain their frontends and be fully responsible for them (similar to what we do on the backend side with microservices). Currently we evaluate using single page apps per team with some commonly shared components, iframes and web components. Each of those approaches has it's own use case and makes sense in a certain setting. So far we tend to prefer a single page app per context and if we need to integrate context specific frontend parts in another context's frontend, we aim for cross-origin iframes, because they provide a clear separation of frontend clients on the authentication side."
OpsGenie,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.opsgenie.com/"">OpsGenie</a> is a modern incident management tool, that routes and consolidates alerts. On-call schedules, escalation strategies and means to alert can be defined."

Resilience Patterns,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"When building distributed applications, keep robustness in mind, where components can tolerate faults within their scope. Therefore, applying resilience patterns are recommended on external components the service relies on. The most known ones being: Circuit Breaker, Fallback, Timeout, Cache and Retry. Since there are many frameworks available, according to the technology used, the best suitable implementation should be decided by the developer team. We recommend Resilience4J as library of choice for implementing those."
Resilience4J,adopt,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j/"">Resilience4j</a> Resilience4j is a lightweight fault tolerance library inspired by Netflix Hystrix, but designed for Java 8 and functional programming."

This can be used for development and testing alike. This keeps code and tests unaware of whether something is mocked or not. Test the application as a user would use it.
Multi-tenancy,trial,Techniques,FALSE,"When testing in production, production data needs to be segregated from test data. This includes data generated by the tests. Also the data lake and tools like Google Analytics should not be affected. One option is, that all services follow the concept of a data sandbox, which is just a form of multi-tenancy. One tenant is production and additional tenants can be created for testing. This would also help with APIs for partners, which typically also require a tenant for testing."
Outbox pattern,trial,Techniques,FALSE,"The <a href=""https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html"">Outbox Pattern</a> describes a solution to reliable publish events when working with database transaction. This pattern is particularly helpful for non-eventsourced applications. Ignoring the problem will lead to inconsistencies.<br />Combining this pattern with a commodity CDC solution like Debzium or AWS DMS could simplify the implementation."
Prettier,trial,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter that supports many languages and integrates with most editors. It has few options which streamlines the configuration for many teams. This allows to auto-format source code on save or before comitting. This eliminates discussions on code style in code reviews.

Testing Library,trial,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) - Simple and complete testing utilities that encourage good testing practices. It follows the principle *""The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.""*. The core library, DOM Testing Library, is a light-weight solution for testing web pages by querying and interacting with DOM nodes (whether simulated with JSDOM/Jest or in the browser). The main utilities it provides involve querying the DOM for nodes in a way that's similar to how the user finds elements on the page. In this way, the library helps ensure your tests give you confidence that your application will work when a real user uses it. There is also a plugin to use it together with cypress."
Vite,trial,Libraries and Frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://vitejs.dev/"">Vite</a> is a modern frontend build tool and dev server based on Rollup. In development it surgically replaces just the files that changed and its dependencies, which is possible thanks to modern browsers' support for native Javascript modules. In addition, it takes advantage of a new class of bundlers written in low-level languages (esbuild in the case of Vite) to be able to pre-bundle dependencies 10-100x faster than bundlers written in Javascript. This allows for a pleasant development experience and quick experimentation."
